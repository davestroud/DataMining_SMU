    "DonorsChoose.org is a crowd-funding website designed for teachers, by teachers. The current state of public school funding often leaves teachers to pay for supplies for projects that are beyond their available budget. In 2000, public school teachers in the Bronx launched DonorsChoose, and it has since spread to be available to all public schools in the United States. \n",
    "\n",
    "Teachers who work full-time in a public school in the US are eligible to submit a project. DonorsChoose then screens and posts the project to the site in a few days. Projects can remain on the site for up to four months. Donors contribute funds toward the projects they are interested in, and when the project is fully funded, DonorsChoose purchases the materials and sends it to the teacher. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset that we are working with was collected and shared on Kaggle by DonorsChoose.org. Because each project is screened before being posted, and the number of requests is expected to be large in coming years, the organization wants to find ways to pre-screen project requests. In doing so, the goal is to be able to auto-approve some requests, which will allow volunteers to focus their time on more complicated project requests. With this data, we will be working to determine which features are most predictive of approval. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is a classification problem, looking to predict whether a project submission is approved or not. To evaluate our predictive model effectiveness, we'll look at the are under the ROC. Because the purpose of this model is to shift work/attention to project submissions that need additional assistnace, a relatively low improvement over random would be considered useful. 10-fold cross-validation"

    "We see a large variety of items being repeated. Looking at the resource summaries for these requests indicates that many of these teachers are looking for sets of certain items. Many of these rows have quantities of 1 listed. Because teachers work in classrooms with many students that are forced to share supplies, it is plausible that the teacher intentionally created requests for the same item multiple times, instead of requesting a high quantity of a single item. \n",
    "\n",
    "This could be because the teacher initially requested one item, reevaluated her class's needs, and just requested the same item again. Or a teacher may not understand how to request multiple copies of the same item, and instead requests multiple singletons. \n",
    "\n",
    "A few of these listings are for requests of quantities greater than 1. These seem to be for class sets of items, perhaps with the goal of providing an item for each student or for every other student. In this case, it is still reasonable to believe the duplicate requests were genuine.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's also important to note that these projects are also getting approved. The evaluation done by DonorsChoose does not immediately disqualify repeating items on the list. This makes sense with the structure around how DonorsChoose fulfills requests. When a teacher is approved, if they recieve the required donations the money goes to DonorsChoose. DC then orders the supplies and ships them directly to the school; requesting multiple items is in no way a cash grab for the teachers. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because teacher requests can contain multiple distinct items, we will need to find the total quantity requested for each item, not just the total number of items requested for the project. "
