    "DonorsChoose.org is a crowd-funding website designed for teachers, by teachers. The current state of public school funding often leaves teachers to pay for supplies for projects that are beyond their available budget. In 2000, public school teachers in the Bronx launched DonorsChoose, and it has since spread to be available to all public schools in the United States. \n",
    "\n",
    "Teachers who work full-time in a public school in the US are eligible to submit a project. DonorsChoose then screens and posts the project to the site in a few days. Projects can remain on the site for up to four months. Donors contribute funds toward the projects they are interested in, and when the project is fully funded, DonorsChoose purchases the materials and sends it to the teacher. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset that we are working with was collected and shared on Kaggle by DonorsChoose.org. Because each project is screened before being posted, and the number of requests is expected to be large in coming years, the organization wants to find ways to pre-screen project requests. In doing so, the goal is to be able to auto-approve some requests, which will allow volunteers to focus their time on more complicated project requests. With this data, we will be working to determine which features are most predictive of approval. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is a classification problem, looking to predict whether a project submission is approved or not. To evaluate our predictive model effectiveness, we'll look at the are under the ROC. Because the purpose of this model is to shift work/attention to project submissions that need additional assistnace, a relatively low improvement over random would be considered useful. 10-fold cross-validation"

    "We see a large variety of items being repeated. Looking at the resource summaries for these requests indicates that many of these teachers are looking for sets of certain items. Many of these rows have quantities of 1 listed. Because teachers work in classrooms with many students that are forced to share supplies, it is plausible that the teacher intentionally created requests for the same item multiple times, instead of requesting a high quantity of a single item. \n",
    "\n",
    "This could be because the teacher initially requested one item, reevaluated her class's needs, and just requested the same item again. Or a teacher may not understand how to request multiple copies of the same item, and instead requests multiple singletons. \n",
    "\n",
    "A few of these listings are for requests of quantities greater than 1. These seem to be for class sets of items, perhaps with the goal of providing an item for each student or for every other student. In this case, it is still reasonable to believe the duplicate requests were genuine.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's also important to note that these projects are also getting approved. The evaluation done by DonorsChoose does not immediately disqualify repeating items on the list. This makes sense with the structure around how DonorsChoose fulfills requests. When a teacher is approved, if they recieve the required donations the money goes to DonorsChoose. DC then orders the supplies and ships them directly to the school; requesting multiple items is in no way a cash grab for the teachers. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because teacher requests can contain multiple distinct items, we will need to find the total quantity requested for each item, not just the total number of items requested for the project. "

    "Above is a histogram of the number of projects previously requested by number of teachers. We see the distribution is heavily left-skewed, with the vast majority of teachers having posted less than 100 projects. The histogram on the right indicates that many of these teachers have posted less than two projects. This makes sense, as DonorsChoose is a charity meant to supplement a teacher with supplies they may need. It is not intended to be a primary provider. This non-uniform distribution is important to keep in mind in the future when predicting project approval, as a teacher who has more experience posting projects will likely have proposals more properly tailored to getting approval than a first-time poster. \n",
    "\n",
    "It also reveals a possibly worrying fact that some teachers are posting a lot of projects, perhaps excessively. This combined with the fact that the minimum total cost of a project is $73 implies that some teachers could potentially be getting thousands of dollars in support from this charity. This could be evidence of either underfunding of certain states or regions, or possible abuse of the charity if a teacher is so reliant on this funding. This however is a topic we are not examining in this analysis. "

    "Looking at the difference in total cost of approved compared to unapproved projects, it seems that approved projects are generally lower cost than non-approved projects. The Rank-Sums test indicates this is the case with very high certainty (p-value < $10^{-100}$). The Rank-Sum test also found statistical evidence that the quantity of items is different between approved and non-approved projects as well. The Rank-Sum test also provides strong evidence that the average item cost is different for approved and non-approved groups, with a similarly high p-value (~$10^{-190}$). We can therefore estimate these quantities using our data. Approved projects typically cost about \\$50 less than un-approved projects; request 4 items fewer; and request items that cost about \\$40 more. \n",

    "What stood out to me the most was one of the questions that DonorsChoose has tasked the data science community with, “How to increase the consistency of project vetting across different volunteers to improve the experience for teachers?” The project approval range is approximately 6% over a period of 13 months, so we do see variation that gives us an indication that there is inconsistency in their approval process. It would be helpful to know more about their approval process. How long does it take? Are there random assignments to projects? Is there a potential for lag time between submission and approval? Could we measure success if the approval range of 6% were reduced?\n",
    "\n",
    "For further analysis, it would be interesting to see what percentage of the approved states have Title I assistance from the US Department of Education. I have not seen this in the data, but after reviewing a few requests from teachers on DonorsChoose’s website, it is often mentioned in teachers proposals. Perhaps this is something that our analysis will be able to determine. The summary portion of our visualization mentions a desire to overlay additional socio-economic attributes to add insight to the approval process. As our model will be using Natural Language processing for different types of analysis, discovering text that specifically mentions Title I in their requests has the potential to uncover patterns that determine whether of not a project will be approved.

    " ### Using the NLTK library and Natural Language Processing with Python \n",
    "\n",
    "Natural Language Processing(NLP) is a field of study focused on making sense of language using statistics and computers. The goal of NLP is to extract meaning and learn from text data. This type of analysis bodes well with the DonorsChoose project, as we have six text variables that need to be analyzed as a part of our model. NLP offers us an attractive opportunity to put the text into a format that is useful for our model. What separates the six variables that we will be using with NLP is that they are not classified as categorical or continuous. Therefore, they need need to be put into a format that is meaningful for our models. This is where Natural Language Processing and the NLTK library can assist our team in making sure that our data is in a format that will offer a model the best opportunity to evaluate the predicted probability and the observed target. \n",
